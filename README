Usage:
  (is pretty simple)

  Enter a number in the number field and press enter. 
  Prefix the number with 0b in case you enter a binary or 0x if you enter a hex number.
  CTRL-d (or d[isplay] button) will toggle through dec-hex-bin.
	
  You may show a bit position pointer by entering the position into the pos field.
  CTRL-t (or the t[oggle] button) will toggle the bit at the position pointed by 'Pos'.

Examples:

  Convert binary 10101010 to hex:
  Enter 0b10101010 into 'Number' and press CTRL-d twice.

  Create a hex number with bit 31 is one:

  Enter 0x0 into 'Number' to indicate you want a hex.
  Enter 31 into 'Pos' and press CTRL-t (or the t button).

  Create a binary number with bit 15 is one:

  Enter 0b0 into 'Number' to indicate you want a binary.
  Enter 15 into 'Pos' and press CTRL-t (or the t button).
